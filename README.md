# phenoAge
This is a web application implemented with HTML, Javascript and Bootstrap5.
Actually it calculates a phenotypic age based on the following documents:

1) "An epigenetic biomarker of aging for lifespan and healthspan"
   https://doi.org/10.18632/aging.101414

2) "A new aging measure captures morbidity and mortality risk across
   diverse subpopulations from NHANES IV: A cohort study"
   https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1002718
   
3) "Correction: A new aging measure captures morbidity and mortality
   risk across diverse subpopulations from NHANES IV: A cohort
   study"
   https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1002760

4) "Association of phenotypic age and accelerated aging with severity
    and disability in patients with acute ischemic stroke"
   http://doi.org/10.1016/j.jnha.2024.100405

The instalation is very simple. Just unpack the compressed file and
run the index.html.

I have tested it on my Desktop as well as on my mobile phone with a
sample from point 4("Association of ...."). Calculation formula based
on the short form of the point 3("Correction: ....")
